# About My Interests

A Myriad of Salutations to you. I am your humble host. I am a UNIX and Linux enthusiast and a bit of a tabletop roleplaying geek. In addition to those, I enjoy a good classic anime and old video game from time to time. 

# About My Personal Identity
I identify as a greybisexual panromantic bigendered individual. I know, a mouthful. I'll break it down.

- greybisexual - I'm attracted to both males and females sexually, but I don't long for a sexual relationship.
- panromantic - I am a huge romantic and don't mind getting swept off of my feet by anyone of any gender.
- bigender - I identify as both masculine and feminine.
