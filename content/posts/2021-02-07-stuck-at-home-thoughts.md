It's not a blizzard, but it certainly is winter. The temps were below zero last night and there's no sign of near freezing point near by. As such, I'm not the kind that wants to go anywhere like it is right now. So, I'm stuck at home until it all fades away.

Someone... please help. I'm going to go mad and I'm not wanting that.
