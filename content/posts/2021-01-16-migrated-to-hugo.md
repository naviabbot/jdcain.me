I've migrated from JekyllRB to GoHugo, mainly due to compilation speed and the fact that [kmartk.art](https://kmartk.art) is built out of the same thing.

## What does this mean?
Nothing much. Just a new look, something similar to [kmartk.art](https://kmartk.art). And yes, it's still all hosted out of my OpenBSD server.
