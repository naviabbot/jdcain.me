I've got a lot of anime I'm in the middle of and I never really get back to it all. I've decided to make an Anime New Years Resolution list. The list is as follows.

- Mobile Fighter G Gundam
- Gundam Build Fighters
- Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Strikers
- Mahoutsukai! PreCure
- Sakura Taisen
- Macross Delta
- Cardfight! Vanguard -overDress-
- Phantasy Star Online 2: Episode Oracle

My goal is to have these series finished by the 7th of January 2023, one week after the New Year 2023.
