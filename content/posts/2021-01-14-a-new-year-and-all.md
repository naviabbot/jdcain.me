Well, it's a new year. We have a new president being sworn in soon and I've made a few resolutions on my own. I'll have to go through quite a bit of oral surgery to fix my mouth and is it expensive.  

Though, I suppose I should list out my plans here for the future - I'm probably going to be migrating this blog over to Hugo, rather than Jekyll. It'll be a bit of work, but the theme will obviously change. I'm thinking of basing it all off of Gruvbox, just so I have something to use that's nice on the eyes. Nord is just too blue.  

Gamewise, I'm waiting for both the Yakuza Collection and PSO2NGS. Both are going to be hopefully excellent.  

I believe that's about all I want to get this about.
