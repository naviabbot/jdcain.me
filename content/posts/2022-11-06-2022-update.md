Sorry that I kept you all waiting. It's been a hectic year. A few highlights of the year:

- July: I received notification back from the WA DOH Vital Records office regarding an ammendment to my birth certificate. I'm now legally nonbinary!
- August: I got a new brother-in-law. The wedding was rather fun and I'm glad I was asked to be an usher.
- October: My boyfriend and I hit our anniversary again and it was a wonderful night.

Which leads me up to this past week. I've received some sad news with my family. Few days after hearing it, I'm still... struggling to process it all. I won't exactly explain what's going on. Family's wishes right now, plus it's not really wise to go about blabbing this sort of information to complete strangers. 

## Anime 2022 Watchlist

I got distracted this year with life and three series - "Spy X Family", "Ya Boy! Kongming", and "RWBY: Ice Queendom". I did get Gundam G done... so I didn't exactly push everything under the rug. I know I won't be able to rush new series in the two months I've left. I'll roll over whatever I have left on the 7th.

## Site Update

Due to a few interests dropping and current hardware restrictions, I've removed some links in the top bar. When will they be back? Dunno.
