I got bored. Not only did I begin linking my sites here and there, I've also put up an email server, because I can. Because shut up. Also, because I've been trying to get one set up for sometime so that 'me@jdcain.me' actually goes somewhere.

I know, it's a narcissistic address. But the domain is my name... so it fits.
