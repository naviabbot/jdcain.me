So, I've got a Raspberry Pi 4. I've done various things with it - mainly just emulation and amateur radio related things. Unfortunately, they never do stick around as my thoughts for plans frequently change and shift. However, after being inspired by a Youtube video of some guy loading OpenMediaVault on a Rock64, I decided to do the same thing with my Pi 4. It is almost as powerful, after all - 1.5 GHz ARM64 processor and 4 GB of memory isn't too terrible to run a NAS on, right?

About so. Now, the Pi isn't too terribly powerful to begin with. Transfer speeds on the wifi are about 30 MB/s and on wire, it's about 10 MB/s. However, it does get the job done.
