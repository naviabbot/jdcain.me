So, I tried submitting my sites to gus.guru, but it's just not... good. The index was last crawled on December. I have recently submitted jdcain.me to geminispace.info's instance of GUS. However, I wanted to channel the classic feeling of the DMOZ... or as it's now known today... Curlie.

That's why dgem exists - the **D**irectory of **GEM**ini Capsules. It's manually curated, like Curlie. If you want your site added, please email me+dgen@jdcain.me or send me a dm @t3hyoshi@pleroma.soykaf.com.
