# Gemini Site

A mirror of this website is available via [Gemini][1].

## What is Gemini?

Gemini is a text based protocol made to coexist alongside Gopher and Web. It's goal is to provide something heavier than richer than Gopher, yet lighter than the Web.

## Why?

We've all been somewhere where the web takes forever to load on mobile devices. I hope that providing this service will bring my website to those who can't afford the mobile data to load the full version.
