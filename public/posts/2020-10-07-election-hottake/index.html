<p>I&rsquo;m trying to not pull from conspiracy theory. Sources are linked or cited when touching conspiracy-like facts.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The United States is designed as a Federal Republic - we elect people who represent us. This includes the Presidential Election - the Electoral College is designed so that we vote for the electors who best represent the area those who elected them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Electoral College is done wrong in most states. A Winner-take-All system for the College is not representative of the constituents of a state. Rather, the votes should be divided among congressional districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The First Past The Post (FPTP) system has failed us at the Popular Vote side on numerous occasions. Ranked Voting is preferred and is being tested in Maine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vote for a third party is not a wasted vote in any system. If anything, it&rsquo;s a vote against the duopoly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The debates aren&rsquo;t serving their actual purpose. If anything, it&rsquo;s an ad for both the Democratic National Party and the Republican National Party. The Commission on Presidential Debates, the people who run the debates, is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/19/us/democrats-and-republicans-form-panel-to-hold-presidential-debates.html?pagewanted=1">bipartisan organization</a> designed to gatekeep the debates (<em>Overruling Democracy: The Supreme Court vs The American People</em> by Raskin, Page 126).</p>
