      <description>I try and stay apolitical with my internet usage. However, 2020&amp;rsquo;s been a rather shit year and I&amp;rsquo;m sick of both Sleepy Joe and Daffy Don trying to pull the strings.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to not pull from conspiracy theory. Sources are linked or cited when touching conspiracy-like facts.
  The United States is designed as a Federal Republic - we elect people who represent us. This includes the Presidential Election - the Electoral College is designed so that we vote for the electors who best represent the area those who elected them.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I try and stay apolitical with my internet usage. However, 2020&amp;rsquo;s been a rather shit year and I&amp;rsquo;m sick of both Sleepy Joe and Daffy Don trying to pull the strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to not pull from conspiracy theory. Sources are linked or cited when touching conspiracy-like facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States is designed as a Federal Republic - we elect people who represent us. This includes the Presidential Election - the Electoral College is designed so that we vote for the electors who best represent the area those who elected them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Electoral College is done wrong in most states. A Winner-take-All system for the College is not representative of the constituents of a state. Rather, the votes should be divided among congressional districts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First Past The Post (FPTP) system has failed us at the Popular Vote side on numerous occasions. Ranked Voting is preferred and is being tested in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vote for a third party is not a wasted vote in any system. If anything, it&amp;rsquo;s a vote against the duopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debates aren&amp;rsquo;t serving their actual purpose. If anything, it&amp;rsquo;s an ad for both the Democratic National Party and the Republican National Party. The Commission on Presidential Debates, the people who run the debates, is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/19/us/democrats-and-republicans-form-panel-to-hold-presidential-debates.html?pagewanted=1&#34;&gt;bipartisan organization&lt;/a&gt; designed to gatekeep the debates (&lt;em&gt;Overruling Democracy: The Supreme Court vs The American People&lt;/em&gt; by Raskin, Page 126).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
