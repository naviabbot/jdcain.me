      <description>A little bit late, but we&amp;rsquo;re up to date. Luckily, this goes for all sites, as there&amp;rsquo;s no real CMS to break into. The upgrade was pretty easy - one simple command - sysupgrade. It downloaded all the filesets and the new kernel before unpacking and rebooting.
Also, there&amp;rsquo;s a recent video about the recent sudo vulnerabilities. The recommendation was to move to doas and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree much more. The config is stupidly simple - just look up &amp;ldquo;man 5 doas.</description>

      <description>I should stop distro hopping. FreeBSD became OpenBSD. Another quick setup and it comes with X already installed, through Xenocera. Not a bad take. However, not every application is available. I just wanted a simple terminal with some easy configuration to do&amp;hellip; well, a binary st exists, but sakura comes with it&amp;rsquo;s colorschemes baked in. No dracula. You know what. I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep it here at OpenBSD. I want to experience the upgrade process.</description>
