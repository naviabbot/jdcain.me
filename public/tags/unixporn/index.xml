      <description>Recently, I decided to dip my toes into FreeBSD. Made the mistake of trying to install from ports, but that was easily fixed by installing packages only. May be stuck on the release cycle of FreeBSD, but so far, the experience was not bad.
The install and X setup took about 4 hours. Everything else was a breeze. I was originally hoping to get Mopidy installed so I can access Spotify in an mpc like setting, but I found Spotifyd instead.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I decided to dip my toes into FreeBSD. Made the mistake of trying to install from ports, but that was easily fixed by installing packages only. May be stuck on the release cycle of FreeBSD, but so far, the experience was not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The install and X setup took about 4 hours. Everything else was a breeze. I was originally hoping to get Mopidy installed so I can access Spotify in an mpc like setting, but I found Spotifyd instead. This was an interesting setup - exactly what the doctor ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set everything up with Spectrwm, borrowing a bit of distrotube&amp;rsquo;s own config. There&amp;rsquo;s still much more to get working, such as baractions.sh, but so far, things are looking pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a screenshot of my config &lt;a href=&#34;https://np.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/gd0ww7/spectrwm_natures_calling_and_dracula_mix/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (NP link to help follow rules)&lt;/p&gt;
