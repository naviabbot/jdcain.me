      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s sort of simple. You&amp;rsquo;ll need a few things, really.
 Rust (Can be installed via rustup.rs) Certbot (pkg install py37-certbot)  Setup The first thing you are going to want to do is to install Rust and Certbot. Once those are installed, follow the instructions below. Replace  with your full domain name.
 cargo install agate certbot certonly --standalone -d &amp;lt;domainname&amp;gt; agate --content path/to/content/ --key /usr/local/etc/letsencrypt/live/domainname/privkey.pem --cert /usr/local/etc/letsencrypt/live/domainname/cert.pem --addr 0.</description>

      <description>So, I lied. I&amp;rsquo;m back on FreeBSD. Mainly because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t live without my Spotifyd and spotify-tui. This time around, I put sddm as part of the startup process. It was simple. Just had to install from pkg. Once installed, I edited my /etc/rc.conf to include sddm_enable=&amp;quot;YES&amp;quot;.
After this was set, I went into /usr/local/etc/sddm.conf and set the theme:
 [Theme]
Current=sddm-freebsd-black-theme
 (Sidenote: This theme is also available in pkg)</description>

      <description>Recently, I decided to dip my toes into FreeBSD. Made the mistake of trying to install from ports, but that was easily fixed by installing packages only. May be stuck on the release cycle of FreeBSD, but so far, the experience was not bad.
The install and X setup took about 4 hours. Everything else was a breeze. I was originally hoping to get Mopidy installed so I can access Spotify in an mpc like setting, but I found Spotifyd instead.</description>
