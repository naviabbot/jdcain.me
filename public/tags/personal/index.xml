      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not a blizzard, but it certainly is winter. The temps were below zero last night and there&amp;rsquo;s no sign of near freezing point near by. As such, I&amp;rsquo;m not the kind that wants to go anywhere like it is right now. So, I&amp;rsquo;m stuck at home until it all fades away.
Someone&amp;hellip; please help. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go mad and I&amp;rsquo;m not wanting that.</description>

      <title>Migrated to Hugo</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve migrated from JekyllRB to GoHugo, mainly due to compilation speed and the fact that kmartk.art is built out of the same thing.
What does this mean? Nothing much. Just a new look, something similar to kmartk.art. And yes, it&amp;rsquo;s still all hosted out of my OpenBSD server.</description>

      <title>A New Year And All</title>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a new year. We have a new president being sworn in soon and I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few resolutions on my own. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to go through quite a bit of oral surgery to fix my mouth and is it expensive.
Though, I suppose I should list out my plans here for the future - I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to be migrating this blog over to Hugo, rather than Jekyll. It&amp;rsquo;ll be a bit of work, but the theme will obviously change.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Though, I suppose I should list out my plans here for the future - I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to be migrating this blog over to Hugo, rather than Jekyll. It&amp;rsquo;ll be a bit of work, but the theme will obviously change. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of basing it all off of Gruvbox, just so I have something to use that&amp;rsquo;s nice on the eyes. Nord is just too blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamewise, I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for both the Yakuza Collection and PSO2NGS. Both are going to be hopefully excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that&amp;rsquo;s about all I want to get this about.&lt;/p&gt;
